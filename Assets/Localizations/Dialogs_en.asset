    m_Localized: Welcome to StellarCorp cadet. The biggest trading corporation in
      the galaxy since 32th century. I will be responsible for your onboarding and
      flight instruction, so you can be a productive member as soon as possible.
      I hope you are better than the last contender. The rescue unit is still picking
      up pieces close to Orionis system.

    m_Localized: Let's start with something basic. The ship needs some power to be
      able to move through the space. Keep pressed the left button on your mouse
      to enable the rear thrusters. This will produce a force that will push your
      ship forward. The longer you press, the faster you travel. Move some meters
      forward.

    m_Localized: 'Good job. It seems you are smart enough to accelerate the ship.
      Impressive. '
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 5216328364032
    m_Localized: As I expect you to know, in the outer space there is almost no physics
      resistance. At least not naturally. That means that if you want to reduce your
      speed, you will need to produce a counter-force towards your on-going direction.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 5483488751616
    m_Localized: 'Which brings us to our next lesson. The front thrusters allows
      you to create this counter-force. As said, this is useful if you want to reduce
      your speed, or even if you want to travel  backwards. '

  - m_Id: 5694013452288
    m_Localized: 'Now, do you see those rocks in front of you? Bad things will happen
      if your ship collides with them. I set up your ship speed slow as hell, so
      you have time to react. Keep pressed the right button in your mouse to enable
      the front thruster. '
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6012197548032
    m_Localized: Now! Enable the front thrusters! (Right-click).

  - m_Id: 6218070765568
    m_Localized: You managed to not explode your ship. It's a good start. Let's go
      with the next lesson. Life would be boring if we were able to move just in
      one line. That's why we live in two dimensions. There are some legends about
      an alien race living in three dimensions. But I don't belive such tales.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6793395056640
    m_Localized: Luckily for us, we live in the real world which is setup in two
      dimensions. That's why we created the Gyroscope. The Gyroscope allows us to
      rotate the ship. Press A or D to rotate left or right. Have in mind, though,
      that you only can rotate if you are moving your ship.  Move your ship to the
      right so you can leave this asteroid belt.

    m_Localized: It seems you are not so useless as the previous candidates. Let's
      put in practice the basic movement of the ship. There is another space station
      nearby. Find it to end your first day of training.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 7782122532864
    m_Localized: You are now ready to manage and control some systems of your ship.
      I enabled the cockpit indicators. You will see one of them in the top left
      of your screen.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8203364872192
    m_Localized: This is the fuel indicator. As you can see you are almost out of
      fuel. If you run out of it while moving your ship, you won't be able to stop.
      Which means you will end potentially crushed onto the surface of a satellite
      or meteorite.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8728290406400
    m_Localized: Luckyly, you have a fuel can close to you. When you move with your
      ship over one of those, your fuel deposit will be refilled a little bit, allowing
      you to survive another day. Pick it now to refill your fuel deposit. Then,
      approach to the station to end your first day of training. Tomorrow I will
      teach you on how to use gravity force produced by celestial bodies, so you
      can accelerate your ship without wasting a gallon of fuel.

    m_Localized: 'This is your first official mission. An easy one if you ask me.
      But you never know with fresh meat like you. An unkonwn artifact entered in
      our system five days ago and it has been orbiting around Seraphis-8 since then. '

    m_Localized: A known collector has hired us to retrieve it. The reward is not
      as juicy as I would expect from a person like this. But it is what is is. So,
      you know what to do. Find the artifact and bring it back here.

    m_Localized: Welcome back cadette. Today you are gonna learn some topic more
      advanced. I assume you know how to control your ship. Let's talk about how
      to safe fuel by taking advantage of gravity produced by planets.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Any object in the universe is producing an attracting force towards
      its center. Even a simple apple. Of course, the bigger the object, the stronger
      the force. That's what we call gravity. Imagine how strong is the gravity produced
      by a planet.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 2894846384025600
    m_Localized: Did you noticed how I approach the planet sideways? This is very
      important. Because if you go upfront, the gravity will pull your ship very
      fast and you won't be able to control it. But if you are able to approach properly,
      you can control your orbit trajectory by facing your ship a little bit towards
      the planet. This will give you some free speed due gravity acceleration.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 2898131941732352
    m_Localized: Pay attention how the ship orbites around the planet and how I scape
      from the orbit at the right moment. Next time you will do it yourself.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3720794964635648
    m_Localized: Now, observe your cockpit. This is the gravity sensor and it will
      help you to know when your ship is being pulled by a strong force like gravity.
      The bigger the force, the stronger it will blink.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4295551632195584
    m_Localized: First of all, we need to approach your ship to the planet in front
      of you. Since this is a dangerous manoeuvre, I will take controll of all the
      systems. Pay attention how I approach to the planet, because it's extremely
      important.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4485305506082816
    m_Localized: We are ready to scape from the orbit. Notice how I use the Gyroscope
      to exit from the gravitational field.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4492817311608832
    m_Localized: So, now it's your turn. There is another planet in front of you
      with a very similar gravity field. Orbitate around it just as I showed you.
      Have in mind that you need to approach with the appropiate speed. Otherwise
      the Gravity Force will be stronger and you will get pull to the planet.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4643948515999744
    m_Localized: You are approaching into a very tight formation of asteroids. When
      you are in a delicate situation like this one, you can use the Warp Engine.
      The Warp Engine will allow you to slow down the time and  be much more precise
      in your movement. Keep pressed space to enable it and go trough those rocks.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4644873389391872
    m_Localized: 'I enabled another system from your cockpit. This is the Quantum
      Energy deposit. Quantum Energy allows you to use the Warp Engine. Once you
      are out of it you won''t be able to use it until you refill it. So use Warp
      Engine smartly. As you can see, you are almost out of it because of your previous
      manoeuvre. You can refill it with the Quantum Energy can you have nearby. '

  - m_Id: 4645600744620032
    m_Localized: Get it, and head to the station. Here concludes your training. Tomorrow
      you will take your first real mission. There is no margin for errors from now
      on. Any mistake you make is affecting StellarCorp. And you don't want to piss
      us off.

    m_Localized: Are you deaf? I told you to not come back until you don't have the
      artifact. I don't want to see you again until you don't have it.
